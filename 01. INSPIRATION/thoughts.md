So I'm watching my ppt and on the fourht slide, the one showing images of street funiture, there is this pic of three men at payphones and I'm thinking "there's no chance something like that would happen today, like seriously, three persons having conversation litteraly inches from each other. Plus there's a lady listiening, might be with the dude on the right.

I always thought of phone boxes and payphones as intimate spaces offering a shelter from the dynamism of the city. However, my very first thought was "that's not intimate at all !". Come on now ! I think it would be interesting to explore this dynamic as well though.

I think maybe people nowadays might feel more conscious about their personal space, not necessarly the physical one, but rather the space they need to defend. So they can protect their intimity, their data, their thoughts. Think about it, hearing somebody's conversation from a PRIVATE smartphone today feels way more intrusif that back in the day when you heard it from a PUBLIC payphone. The same way people might call you out if they catch you watching their phone while they use it, they might act the same way if you stood inches from them to make a phone call from your smartphone in the same space.

Spaces man. that's it. Spaces are so different now from what they were before. Less human space sharing. if that makes sense. And you know what ? it would actually b fucking hilarious to have a space deicated to make phone calls from you smartphone. Where people just stand inches from each other separated by a half booth like in this picture. Impossible to imagine something like that take place today right ? Who would do that ?

And this ladies and gents might b the stupidest reflection ever or some genius material.
